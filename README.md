A passionate Software Engineer and Former Competitive Programmer.

I am a former competitive programmer and two-time champion of the BRACU Intra University Programming Contest. I have participated in both national and international competitions, including the ICPC and NCPC, where I honed my problem-solving skills and gained invaluable experience collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the field.

With a profound interest in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Game Design, I strive to bridge creativity and technology to solve real-world problems. Drawing from my background as a painter and professional graphics designer, I approach software development with a creative mindset, blending imagination and analytical skills to build innovative solutions.

My core skills lie in JavaScript, C++, Algorithms, Data Structures, Shopify and Python, complemented by hands-on experience working with cutting-edge AI applications and production-level software development.

Skills: PHP / REACT / VUE / C++ / PYTHON
